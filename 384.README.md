# VSCode Loader - SB384

For details on usage and development see the main [README].

This version tracks psm384 fork of vscode-loader. Use branch "dev".

(Minimal) modifications to support SB384FS.

So far, around March 2023 I experimented with changes in:

   src/core/moduleManager.ts
   src/core/scriptLoader.ts

and got the build to work which yields:

   src/loader.js

And of course added this file.

Changes are tagged "SB384". The "SB384FS" idea is that a wrapper app
can point assets to fetch shards instead of going to http requests.

The strategy works, but, not yet clear how it should fit into our
larger strategy of dApps. But, conclusion was that it's totally
tractable to modify this (powerful and general purpose) loader.
